# ProcrastiMate


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Aswanth Madhav 


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aswanth Madhav - Model Engineering College


### Project Description
A productivity-ish platform with a feel-good vibe. Set a timer, laugh at dumb quotes, and check off the most useless to-dos ever written — all while pretty bubbles float around you.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes productivity apps are too productive. Like chill, Karen — maybe I just wanna stare at the screen and vibe.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An aesthetic, slow-moving, dopamine-boosting page where you can pretend to be productive while actually doing... nothing. Floaty bubbles, useless quotes, and to-dos like “touch grass” await. That makes you feel that Five star is right 



## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Frameworks: None, raw chaos only

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
![Screenshot1] ![alt text](<hero page.png>)
Time flies when you’re pretending to work.

![Screenshot2]![alt text](index.png)
THis is where you can hallucinate that you are working , or aybe show your parents you are . 

![Screenshot3]![alt text](<3rd page.png>)
Highly motivating quotes 

# Diagrams
![Workflow]![alt text](workflow.png)
When you press the start button on the hero page , it redirects you to the main page , in the main page when you press the focus button , it redirects you to a random yt video which is decided by the js working behind , the to do list auto updates with random to dos with the help of js  , the stats container gives random stats , the timer works in a qwerky way ,with the help of js which changes the time . 





### Project Demo
# Video

So it all starts with you looking at the hero page , which you might thing i repeat might think that the meme is good , and there is a button screaming at you to click it , then you are redirected to the main page where you see the stairs to heaven of productivity , the focus session , a timer , productivity stats , quotes , to do list , what else could you need , the only thing is they wont work as you intend them to , so basically useless , but is it ? and then you redirected to the motivational quotes page, which will motivate you to do nothing , and again five star wins .
